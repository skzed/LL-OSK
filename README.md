# LL-OSK README

This README has been written before starting on the initial project and having only the idea in mind.

LL-OSK ( Language Learning On Screen Keyboard ) is a project of mine, which I've made... 

* To learn or aid in the learning of the russian language.
* As a fun experience to possibly learn a bit more of or about programming.
* And as a way to hopefully learn how to correctly use GitHub as a beginner.

The purpose of LL-OSK is to aid in the learning process of a language's keyboard layout.

I currently don't have any plans to make LL-OSK work for languages other than russian, 
but I will try to make it flexible in a way that could support languages added by other people.

Please keep in mind that neither English nor Russian are my native languages and,
that there is a possibility of mistakes related to grammar, definitions or anything alike.

## Update
Currently unable to work on this due to being busy with other things :(
